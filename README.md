Hello experts,
I hope you are doing well.
this is my first ever python application on Github, every suggestion is welcomed
basically its got 3 codes 
1. processes via Tesseract OCR
2. processes via Google's vision API(you have to setup and get Service account token)
3. ss.py(new) used OCR api for platform independence

Instructions:
1. install dependencies
2. execute the code with python
(well for windows you got to download the tesseract*.exe file and add its path to environment variables
guide can be found here https://medium.com/@ahmetxgenc/how-to-use-tesseract-on-windows-fe9d2a9ba5c6)
